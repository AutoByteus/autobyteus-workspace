# Agent Execution

## Scope

Manages runtime agent runs and message execution flow.

## TS Source

- `src/agent-execution/services/agent-run-manager.ts` (`AgentRunManager`)
- `src/api/graphql/types/agent-run.ts`
- `src/services/agent-streaming/agent-stream-handler.ts`
- `src/api/websocket/agent.ts`

## Notes

Runtime managers compose definitions, prompts, tools, processors, and workspace context.

`AgentRunManager` also owns active-run sidecars that must be attached independently of websocket clients. For Codex and Claude runs with a `memoryDir`, it attaches `AgentRunMemoryRecorder` so accepted user commands and normalized runtime events are written to server-owned local memory even when no browser is subscribed to the live stream. Native AutoByteus runs are skipped by that recorder because their memory remains owned by the native `autobyteus-ts` memory manager.

`AgentRun.postUserMessage(...)` exposes an internal command-observer seam. Observers are notified only after the message is accepted, and observer failures are isolated from the user-message result.

See [Agent Memory](./agent_memory.md) for the storage-only recorder contract and memory-file boundaries.

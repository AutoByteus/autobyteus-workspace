# Delivery / Release / Deployment Report

## Release / Publication / Deployment Scope

No release, publication, deployment, version bump, or tag is in scope. The user verified the local Electron test build and explicitly requested ticket finalization with no new version. This finalization pass archives the ticket, commits/pushes the ticket branch, merges into `personal`, and skips release/deployment.

## Handoff Summary

- Handoff summary artifact: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/single-agent-run-title-initial-message/tickets/done/single-agent-run-title-initial-message/handoff-summary.md`
- Handoff summary status: `Updated`
- Notes: The handoff records the implemented stable single-agent history-title behavior, latest-base integration refresh, post-integration checks, docs sync, residual limits, and user verification release of the finalization hold.

## Initial Delivery Integration Refresh

- Bootstrap base reference: `origin/personal @ 56bd1b1e60921f686d5b4d080833cae60279040b`
- Latest tracked remote base reference checked: `origin/personal @ 9d8a1aa665d6193399ee806c1150c3f56c47c21a`
- Base advanced since bootstrap or previous refresh: `Yes` — branch was behind `origin/personal` by 2 commits at delivery start.
- New base commits integrated into the ticket branch: `Yes` — `6bc9a0fa` and `9d8a1aa6`.
- Local checkpoint commit result: `Completed` — `839b80c265d993792a553100bc254faf6f131055` preserved the reviewed/validated candidate before integration.
- Integration method: `Merge`
- Integration result: `Completed` — merge commit `cc35d54453d0dcf3ad619f8c5a0ffecd7420e9d4`.
- Post-integration executable checks rerun: `Yes`
- Post-integration verification result: `Passed`
- No-rerun rationale (only if no new base commits were integrated): `N/A`
- Delivery edits started only after integrated state was current: `Yes`
- Handoff state current with latest tracked remote base: `Yes` — `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/personal` returned `2 0` before delivery-owned docs/report edits.
- Blocker (if applicable): `None for verification handoff; repository finalization is intentionally blocked pending user verification.`

Refresh and integration evidence:

- `git fetch origin personal --prune` — passed.
- At delivery start: `HEAD @ 56bd1b1e60921f686d5b4d080833cae60279040b`, `origin/personal @ 9d8a1aa665d6193399ee806c1150c3f56c47c21a`, ahead/behind `0 2`.

- Initial verification reference: User stated on 2026-05-12: "i finished the testing. the ticket is done. lets finalize the ticket, and no need to release a new version".

- Renewed verification received: `Not needed`
- Renewed verification reference: `N/A`

## Docs Sync Result

- Docs sync artifact: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/single-agent-run-title-initial-message/tickets/done/single-agent-run-title-initial-message/docs-sync-report.md`

- Archived ticket path: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-worktrees/single-agent-run-title-initial-message/tickets/done/single-agent-run-title-initial-message` before merge; after target merge the durable archived path is `tickets/done/single-agent-run-title-initial-message`.

## Version / Tag / Release Commit

No version bump, tag, release commit, release notes artifact, publication, or deployment is required because the user explicitly requested no new version.

## Repository Finalization

- Bootstrap context source: `tickets/done/single-agent-run-title-initial-message/investigation-notes.md` records bootstrap base `origin/personal`, ticket branch `codex/single-agent-run-title-initial-message`, expected finalization target `personal`, and worktree creation from `origin/personal @ 56bd1b1e60921f686d5b4d080833cae60279040b`.
- Ticket branch: `codex/single-agent-run-title-initial-message`

- Ticket branch push result: `Proceeding after finalization commit`
- Finalization target remote: `origin`
- Finalization target branch: `personal`
- Target advanced after user verification: `No` (`git fetch origin personal`; branch remained ahead 2 / behind 0 before finalization commit).
- Delivery-owned edits protected before re-integration: `Not needed`; target did not advance.
- Re-integration before final merge result: `Not needed`
- Target branch update result: `Proceeding`

## Escalation / Reroute (Use Only If Final Handoff Cannot Complete)

- Classification: `N/A`
- Recommended recipient: `N/A`
- Why final handoff could not complete: `N/A — verification handoff is complete; only finalization is waiting for user verification.`

## Release Notes Summary

- Release notes artifact created before verification: `No`
- Archived release notes artifact used for release/publication: `N/A`
- Release notes status: `Not required`

## Deployment Steps

No deployment steps are required for the current scope.

Local test build prepared for user verification:

- README guidance reviewed: `autobyteus-web/README.md` documents `pnpm build:electron:mac` for macOS and the local no-notarization/timestamping env pattern.
- Command used: `NO_TIMESTAMP=1 APPLE_TEAM_ID= APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY= CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false AUTOBYTEUS_BUILD_FLAVOR=personal pnpm build:electron:mac`.
- Result: passed; local macOS arm64 DMG/ZIP/app bundle are available under `autobyteus-web/electron-dist/`.
- Packaging note: code signing/notarization/timestamping were intentionally disabled for this local verification build; this does not constitute a release/deployment.

## Environment Or Migration Notes

- No database migration, installer migration, release packaging, or deployment is included in this ticket.
- Already-mutated inactive historical run-history rows are intentionally not migrated.
- Live Codex E2E execution requires `RUN_CODEX_E2E=1`, local Codex runtime availability, and API credentials; without the env flag, the durable E2E compiles/imports and skips by design.
- The isolated worktree dependencies were bootstrapped earlier with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` during implementation.

## Verification Checks

Authoritative validation checks accepted from API/E2E and code review:

- Live Codex E2E with `RUN_CODEX_E2E=1 CODEX_HISTORY_TITLE_E2E_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini` — passed, 1 test.
- Focused backend run-history tests — passed, 25 tests.
- Focused frontend live merge test — passed, 3 tests.
- Server build — passed.
- Code-review Round 3 compile/skip check for the durable live E2E — passed as skipped while compiling/importing.
- Code-review whitespace/conflict-marker checks — passed.

Delivery-stage checks after integrating latest `origin/personal`:

- `git diff --check origin/personal...HEAD` — passed.
- Focused backend run-history tests — passed, 25 tests.
- Focused frontend live merge test — passed, 3 tests.
- Durable live E2E compile/skip check without `RUN_CODEX_E2E=1` — passed as skipped while compiling/importing.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-server-ts build` — passed.
- `git diff --check` after delivery docs/report edits — passed.
- Untracked delivery artifact whitespace/conflict-marker scan — passed.
- User-requested local Electron build for macOS arm64 — passed; artifacts are in `autobyteus-web/electron-dist/`.

## Rollback Criteria

Before finalization: do not merge the ticket branch if user verification shows that a single-agent Codex/workspace history row still changes from the opening message to a later follow-up such as `do it`, if status/time updates stop reflecting follow-up activity, if active rows with known live first-user-message context still display a stale latest-message title, or if agent-team row title behavior regresses. Route implementation defects to `implementation_engineer`; route ambiguity about title semantics or inactive historical migration scope to `solution_designer`.

After finalization, if ever needed: revert the final merge/commit that introduces the backend queued summary invariant, active read-side repair, frontend first-user-message live overlay, durable E2E/unit/frontend tests, docs updates, and ticket artifacts.

## Final Status

User verification received. Ticket archival, finalization commit, push/merge, and cleanup are proceeding. Release/deployment is intentionally skipped because the user requested no new version.

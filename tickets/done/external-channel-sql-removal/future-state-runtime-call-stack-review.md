## Round Artifact Update Log (Mandatory)

## Missing-Use-Case Discovery Log (Mandatory Per Round)

| Round | Discovery Lens | New Use Case IDs (`None` if no new case) | Source Type | Why Previously Missing | Classification | Upstream Update Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Requirement coverage / boundary crossing / fallback-error / design-risk | None | N/A | N/A | N/A | No |
| 2 | Requirement coverage / boundary crossing / fallback-error / design-risk | None | N/A | N/A | N/A | No |
| 3 | Requirement coverage / boundary crossing / fallback-error / design-risk | UC-003 | Requirement | The original ticket focused on removing one noisy SQL path and had not yet modeled shared Prisma client log policy as a separate owned spine. | Requirement Gap | Yes |
| 4 | Requirement coverage / boundary crossing / fallback-error / design-risk | None | N/A | N/A | N/A | No |

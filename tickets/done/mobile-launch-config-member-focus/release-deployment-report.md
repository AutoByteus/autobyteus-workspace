## Version / Tag / Release Commit

No version bump, release commit, or tag will be created for this task because the user explicitly requested no new release/version. The prepared release-notes artifact remains archived for traceability only and is not used for publication.

## Release Notes Summary

- Release notes artifact created before verification: `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-workspace-superrepo/tickets/done/mobile-launch-config-member-focus/release-notes.md`
- Archived release notes artifact used for release/publication: Not used; no release/version requested.
- Release notes status: `Not required`

## Deployment Steps

None performed. No deployment requested.

## Environment Or Migration Notes

- No backend schema, storage migration, native wrapper, or deployment environment changes are required.
- Mobile behavior remains under `/mobile`; normal desktop/Electron and desktop web routes remain isolated from the mobile shell.
- Focused-member memory is current-client local and not cross-device/backend durable persistence.

## Verification Checks

- `pnpm -C autobyteus-web exec vitest run components/mobile/__tests__/MobileUxRefinement.spec.ts components/mobile/__tests__/MobileContextSelectionRegression.spec.ts components/mobile/__tests__/MobileRemoteAccessShell.spec.ts components/workspace/config/__tests__/TeamRunConfigForm.spec.ts components/workspace/config/__tests__/RunConfigPanel.spec.ts` — Passed, 5 files / 46 tests.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-web exec vitest run stores/__tests__/agentTeamContextsStore.spec.ts stores/__tests__/activeContextStore.spec.ts stores/__tests__/agentTeamRunStore.spec.ts` — Passed, 3 files / 25 tests.
- `pnpm -C autobyteus-web exec nuxi typecheck` — Full repository remains red from existing unrelated diagnostics; changed mobile/composable/store filter emitted no diagnostics. Expanded desktop-config filter matched only unmodified existing `TeamRunConfigForm.spec.ts` diagnostics.
- `NO_TIMESTAMP=1 APPLE_TEAM_ID= AUTOBYTEUS_BUILD_FLAVOR=personal pnpm -C autobyteus-web build:electron:mac` — Passed; generated local macOS ARM64 DMG/ZIP/app under `autobyteus-web/electron-dist/` in the dedicated ticket worktree before cleanup.
- API/E2E authoritative validation report: Passed in Round 3 at `/Users/normy/autobyteus_org/autobyteus-workspace-superrepo/tickets/done/mobile-launch-config-member-focus/api-e2e-validation-report.md`.

## Rollback Criteria

Rollback or block finalization if user verification finds any of the following on the integrated branch:

- Successful fresh pairing reaches stable Home with stale `Unknown` status instead of post-pair checking followed by connected/actionable Home.
- Mobile launch loses selected runtime/model or silently falls back to hidden desktop defaults.
- Team launch first prompt is not routed to the selected first-message target.
- Existing-run Message target appears on Runs or competes with Start new.
- Recent team-run reopen restores an invalid/stale member instead of a valid remembered or fallback focus.
- Desktop run configuration or team launch controls regress.

## Final Status

Completed. The ticket branch was committed, pushed, merged into `personal`, and pushed to `origin/personal`. The dedicated ticket worktree, local ticket branch, and remote ticket branch were cleaned up. No release, version bump, tag, publication, or deployment was performed per user request.
